# Command Reference — terminal-stack (Windows / PowerShell)

Everything this stack puts at your fingertips on the Windows side. Type `ref`
to open this file. Machine-specific commands go in
`%USERPROFILE%\command-reference.local.md` — untracked, appended by `ref`
automatically. The same content also ships as
`%USERPROFILE%\command-reference.html` (open in a browser) and
`%USERPROFILE%\command-reference.txt` (plain text) — regenerated whenever this
file changes.

## WezTerm (leader = `Ctrl+Space`, 1.5s window)

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Space h` | split pane side by side (new pane on the right) |
| `Ctrl+Space v` | split pane top/bottom (new pane below) |
| `Ctrl+Space H` | pick a domain (local / WSL / SSH…) and split it on the right |
| `Ctrl+Space V` | pick a domain and split it below |
| `Ctrl+Space j/k/i/m` | move between panes (left/right/up/down) |
| `Ctrl+Space J/K/I/M` | resize active pane (5 cells) |
| `Ctrl+Space z` | zoom/unzoom active pane (fullscreen within tab) |
| `Ctrl+Space x` | close the active pane (asks to confirm) |
| `F1` / `F2` / `F3` / `F4` | jump to pane: top-left / top-right / bottom-left / bottom-right |
| `Ctrl+Space 1/2/3/4` | same as F1–F4 (fallback if F-keys are captured by the OS) |
| `Ctrl+Space w` | workspace picker (fuzzy) |
| `Ctrl+Space n` | new named workspace |
| `Ctrl+Space R` | rename the current workspace |
| `Ctrl+Space X` | close every pane in the current workspace ("delete" it) |
| `Ctrl+Space o` | pop the current pane out into a new window |
| `Ctrl+Shift+O` | pop the current pane out (quick access, no leader) |
| `Ctrl+Space r` | reload the WezTerm configuration (after editing .wezterm.lua or pane_grid.lua etc.) |
| `Alt+1` … `Alt+9` | switch directly to tab 1–9 — no leader; the number matches the tab |
| `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | next / previous tab |
| `Ctrl+Space Ctrl+Space` | send a literal Ctrl+Space through |
| `Alt+L` | launcher menu (includes TABS and WORKSPACES) |
| `Ctrl+V` | paste |

**Recommended model (one WezTerm OS window):** Use WezTerm *workspaces* (Ctrl+Space, w fuzzy picker, Ctrl+Space, n to create) as the unit of "what I'm working on" (Project-Alpha vs Project-Beta). Inside a workspace use *panes* (Ctrl+Space, h / v to split, j/k/i/m to move, J/K/I/M to resize, z to zoom, 1-4 / F1-4 for the four quadrants of a 2×2) for things you want to watch simultaneously. Need a remote shell beside your work? Ctrl+Space, H (right) or V (below) opens a domain picker — choose an SSH or WSL domain and it splits that in. Tabs are cheap full-screen flips within a workspace; jump straight to one with Alt+1…9. Each tab is labelled with its number and directory (e.g. `2: terminal-stack`) and tints green when Claude finishes / red on error; the top-right shows the active workspace and current path. This replaces the need for multiple top-level WezTerm windows.

**Managing workspaces:** rename the current one with `Ctrl+Space R`; "delete" a live one with `Ctrl+Space X` (closes all its panes).

## git

### Shell functions (typed bare)

| Function | Full command | Note |

| `gd` | `git diff` | |
| `ga` | `git add` | |
| `gb` | `git branch` | |

### git-config aliases (work as `git <alias>`, from the stack's git include)

| Alias | Full command |
